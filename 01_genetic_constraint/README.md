# Genetic Constraint

We measured [genetic constraint](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/constraint) within the genes containing infertility-associated loci using measures of loss-of-function intolerance and a metric of intolerance to synonymous and missense variation from [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
