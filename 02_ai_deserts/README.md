# Archaic Introgression Deserts

We obtained Neanderthal introgression deserts from Sankararaman et al. [(2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216302470?via%3Dihub).  

We used bedtools intersect to overlap with genes containing infertility associated loci and used a hypergeometric test in R to test over-representation of genes containing infertility-associated loci within introgression deserts.
